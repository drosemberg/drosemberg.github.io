  <p id= "about-me" Hello! I'm Dieunane Rosemberg and I was bron in Haiti.
 Now growing up in Haiti wasn't that fun. I din't  spend lots to time with my mohter.
 But thank goodness I was bale to come to the U.S.A and from that i own I get to learn lots of things.
 But the  most important thing is that  I'm grateful of living with my mother and feel peace.</body>
